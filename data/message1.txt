x: distance $ y: extraction (solid line) $ y: consumption (dotted lines) 
20128
Efficiency: the higher the distance between the position where the minerals are mined and the building, $ the fewer resources are extracted in a given time $ note: the resource consumption (if the building has any) is proportional to the time, not the resource production!

The bars indicate the relative amount of resources that is available $ the single lines indicate the absolute amount of resources, which is relative amount * number of fields
