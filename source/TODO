TODO list for ASC, programming department.

-1- is very high priority
-9- is very low  priority


Bugs:

 -  640*480 building dlg
 -  subbase.map

 -  redraw problems with Win9x after task switch
 

 - *.ascmapxlat
 
=========

Small tasks:

-7- direct invocation of and from mail clients to automate email games

-5- replacing those ugly dynamic_array templates by std::vector


-6- reaction fire doesn't fire on units which can suddenly be seen not because
    they themselfes are moving, but because some jamming vehicle went away.

-6- displaying the cost for constructing buildings somewhere

-7- movement cost for putObject action


Medium sized tasks


 Since DOS is no longer supported by ASC, we can now rewrite much legacy code
 to make use of features modern operating system and even Windows provide:


-8-  input/output of raw height information in mapgenerator
     for usage by terragen or similar programs

-6-  the units that are destroyed by terrain change or lack or fuel (airplanes
     only) should be recorded in some kind of replay.

-3-  some statistics screen that lists your losses and the losses you inflicted
     at the enemy

Larger Tasks:

-2-  maintaining and improving the mapeditor
     Especially the user interface of the mapeditor has some room for
     improvements. This jobs involves asking the map-designers what they think
     should be improved there and then do it...


Requested features:

-  A result screen in multiplayergames (who list how many units until now,
    lost buildings, gained resources, ... )

-  A confirmation setting screen 

-  map parameter: increased airplane fuel usage to allow realistic maps
   where airplanes can't 'stand' in midair for longer periods of time


-  Guenter Beine on 2000-12-13 :
   I like to make a proposal for the keybindings. Especially canceling an action
   is handled in different ways according to the proposed action i. e. moving,
   attacking, constructing etc. Canceling an activated attack is the best way. If
   you want to renounce an attack you mark a field that can not be attacked or
   simply the unit that you planed to make the attack and press the a-key again to
   abort the action. Or you mark another unit and press the a-key to get the same
   result. Pressing the key once more makes the marked unit ready to attack. I
   think handling of the game would be more easy if every action would be enabled
   and canceled by this way.

- internationalization

- infotext should be displayed by right clicking on the description in the main 
  screen
