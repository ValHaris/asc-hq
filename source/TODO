TODO list for ASC, programming department.

-1- is very high priority
-9- is very low  priority


Bugs:

 -  unit can only leave a transport on one level height
    ( bigger-prob )

 -  640*480 building dlg
 -  subbase.map

 -  redraw problems with Win9x after task switch
 
 -  !!! Wind problems !!! windbug.asc

=========

Small tasks:

-4- Replay: don't repeat identical inconsistency messages

-5- Message of crashed airplanes when they run out of fuel

-7- writing a TPWM decoder for Battle Isle maps

-8- rewriting tdrawgettempline ( mapalgorithm.cpp ) which is way to slow
   
-7- direct invocation of and from mail clients to automate email games

-5- replacing those ugly dynamic_array templates by std::vector

-9- Optimize  int VehicleMovement::getDistance ( int x, int y) in unitctrl.cpp
    This function is pretty slow, but not called often enough to really 
    beeing a problem
    => not so important

-6- Caching of fullscreen image ( file sdl/loadimage.c )
    converting an image from 24 bitt to 8 bit and resizing it is quite slow.
    The image could be cached as PCX with 8 bit and correct resolution to be
    loaded faster the next time.
    -- not very important --

-6- reaction fire doesn't fire on units which can suddenly be seen not because
    they themselfes are moving, but because some jamming vehicle went away.

-5- save date&time in email games

-3- scrollable unit/building cargo (unlimited number of units)

-8- new vehicletype property: Number of loadable units (not only limiting 
    by weight)

-6- displaying the cost for constructing buildings somewhere

-7- movement cost for putObject action

-8-  kamikaze weapon

-6- resize graphics to contain all vehicle categories in weapon info


Medium sized tasks


 Since DOS is no longer supported by ASC, we can now rewrite much legacy code
 to make use of features modern operating system and even Windows provide:


-3-  Introducing Truetype font support. 
     Although the current font handling routines are quite old, I still think 
     they are quite ok and relatively fast. But the creation of font files is 
     problematic. The tfont structures should be created on program start from
     TTF fonts. The SDL_TTF library provides the necessary background routines

-2-  new Keyboard handling. 
     The handling of keyboard input was the biggest pain-in-the-ass under DOS.
     The keyboard routines should be completely redesigend. Searching for
     NEWKEYB will reveal all cruicial parts of the code which may be greatly
     simplified with a new key class that routines like rkey should return.

-2-  new string handling
     replacing all occurances of c-style strings (char*) and c++ strings
     (std::string) by the new ASCString class (which is derived from
     std::string)

-5-  new image storage for objects, so the images can be changed by graphic 
     sets even when they were generated on runtime (mirroring)

-5-  displaying objects on the small map

-8-  embedding of units/objects/... in map
     -> requires reinitialization of gui host

-4-  check working condition of neutral events

-5-  generalize height changing of units (needed for Sy-Set)
     submarines, ascend, descent, behaviour is currently fixed for certain 
     levels

-8-  input/output of raw height information in mapgenerator
     for usage by terragen or similar programs

-6-  the units that are destroyed by terrain change or lack or fuel (airplanes
     only) should be recorded in some kind of replay.

-3-  some statistics screen that lists your losses and the losses you inflicted
     at the enemy

Larger Tasks:

-1-  Rewriting the whole graphics engine
     Currently is graphics engine is 8 bit depth only, cannot use hardware 
     acceleration and an image is just a void* pointer (resulting in all the
     delete void* warnings on compilation).

     Creating a class that represents images and on which all graphic 
     functions operate. 
     This class should probably be a wrapper around a SDL_image structure.

-2-  maintaining and improving the mapeditor
     Especially the user interface of the mapeditor has some room for
     improvements. This jobs involves asking the map-designers what they think
     should be improved there and then do it...
     Some things like copy&paste would be really nice there too.
     Not to mention the reinforcements event...
     Or a function to make a diff between two maps and use it for a 
      map-change event...

-2- adding inheritance to the text file formats

-3- Paragui has been chosen to be the new dialog engine for ASC.
    Now many old and outdated dialogs (like the VehicleInfo dialog)
    should be rewritten (www.paragui.org)


Requested features:

-  A result screen in multiplayergames (who list how many units until now,
    lost buildings, gained resources, ... )

-  A confirmation setting screen 

-  map parameter: increased airplane fuel usage to allow realistic maps
   where airplanes can't 'stand' in midair for longer periods of time


-  Guenter Beine on 2000-12-13 :
   I like to make a proposal for the keybindings. Especially canceling an action
   is handled in different ways according to the proposed action i. e. moving,
   attacking, constructing etc. Canceling an activated attack is the best way. If
   you want to renounce an attack you mark a field that can not be attacked or
   simply the unit that you planed to make the attack and press the a-key again to
   abort the action. Or you mark another unit and press the a-key to get the same
   result. Pressing the key once more makes the marked unit ready to attack. I
   think handling of the game would be more easy if every action would be enabled
   and canceled by this way.

- internationalization

- infotext should be displayed by right clicking on the description in the main 
  screen
  
>Zu den baubaren/abreissbaren objekten Objekten. Jedes baubare oder
>abreissbare Objekt erh„lt optional eine "Scrap-ID". zb. Straáe=1 , Brcke=2,
>Wald=3, Felsen=10 ....

- BI1 Blocking  

Requested features whos necessity should be discussed...

-  loading of savegames in the mapeditor 
-  different jamming power for a unit on different levels of height

-  setting up new production facilities ingame
